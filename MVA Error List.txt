Code	Description
516001	TopicLookupTable received an unnamed Add Topic request and ignored it. Topic requests and subscriptions must be named.
516002	An abstract Transport object was called to send real data, meaning nothing was transported. The developer must provide a concrete Transport type.
516003	The software attempted to open a reference to an abstract ISubscriptionPolicy object. The developer must provide a concrete policy type to establish a subscription.
516004	Send Synchronous Message timed out before receiving a reply.
516005  TopicLookupTable does not contain the requested information for Topic "%s".
516006	An Actor attempted to register for an invalid event type; This EventHandler does not allow registrations of type "%s".

*** Transport Errors (Concrete) ***
517001	The boolean text update failed because BooleanTextBinding class does not support binding data of type "%s".
517002	The listbox update failed because (MC)ListboxItemNamesBinding class does not support the bound data type (type "%s", dimension=%d, element type"%s").
517003	The string update failed because FormattedStringBinding class does not support binding data of type "%s".
517004	The QueueTransport class timed out while waiting for data.
517005	The wired control reference to "%s" can not be bound. If the control type is Boolean, ensure that its mechanical action is set to switching.
517006	The ControlCaptionBinding failed because the bound control "%s" does not have a caption property. Ensure that the control's caption property exists before run-time.
